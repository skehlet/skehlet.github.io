	    <h1>404 Page not found</h1>

		<p>
			I retired my old blog so many of those pages are no longer available.
			More information is available on <a href="/articles/blog.html">My Blog
			Has Been Retired</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you're not here for one of my retired blog articles, then this is
			just a normal 404, the page you're looking for was not found. Please try
			the <a href="/">top level of my site</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Thanks!
