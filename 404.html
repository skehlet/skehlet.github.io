		<h1>Sorry about this!</h1>
		
		I retired my old blog so many of those pages are no longer available.
		More information is available on <a href="/articles/blog.html">My Blog
		Has Been Retired</a>.

		If you're not here for one of my retired blog articles, then this is
		just a normal 404, the page you're looking for was not found. Please try
		the <a href="/">top level of my site</a>.

		Thanks!
