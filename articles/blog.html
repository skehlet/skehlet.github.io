    <h1>My Blog Has Been Retired</h1>

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve finally retired the content from my old blog. It’s been years since I
      added anything to it and the annual renewal costs for the
      <em>kehlet.cx</em> domain are getting to be too much.
    </p>

    <h2>Was it all just so much garbage, to be thrown out?</h2>

    <p>
      No, I’ve preserved 
      <a href="/articles/79.html">Subnetting is Fun</a>
      (as well as its associated <a
      href="/subnetting-is-fun/index.html">Subnetting Quiz</a>) and <a
      href="/articles/99.html">Tuning TCP for High Bandwidth-Delay Networks</a>,
      two articles I felt were genuinely useful. They can be found here under
      <em>stevekehlet.com</em>, which is much less expensive and I
      plan to keep around for the foreseeable future.
    </p>

    <h2>I really want to read about your “Water Heater Disaster” and see photos
    from your delicious “Chicken Dinner” article, can I still find them?</h2>

    <p>Yes, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Internet Archive Wayback
    Machine</a> never forgets, you can find those articles and other gems <a
    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201206070512/http://www.kehlet.cx/">archived
    there</a>.</p>
