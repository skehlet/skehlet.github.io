<div id="articleBody">
<a href="/subnetting-is-fun/index.html"><img src="/docs/2004/03/subnet_quiz_small.jpg"
alt="Subnet Quiz" align="left" height="193" width="300" /></a>
Here is a web-based quiz I wrote a while back to <a
href="/subnetting-is-fun/index.html">practice your subnetting skills</a>.
[<b>Update</b>: in 2014, I converted it to Javascript so it would run
completely in your browser]. Given an IP and a
netmask, you derive the network and broadcast addresses.  I wrote it to prep for the <a
href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/learning/le3/le2/le0/le9/learning_certification_type_home.html">CCNA</a>
exam and to sharpen my on-the-job subnetting skills.  For extra challenge, you can select
"Advanced subnets" to have the program randomly give you the netmask in either dotted
decimal (the default), hex, or slash notation. 

<br><br>

The obnoxious cliche "practice, practice, practice" really describes the best way to get
better at subnetting.  It's part memorization, part basic math skills, but 90% practice. 
In other words, stopping after you understand how the bits work isn't enough, to be quick
you need to repeatedly drill yourself with a program like this one.  

<br><br>

I hope to publish a followup article on one way to easily subnet soon.  If
you're interested in the quiz program itself, you can <a
href="https://github.com/skehlet/subnetting-is-fun">look at the source code on
Github</a>.

<br><br>

<i>Update March 26, 2009:</i> I ran across an article called <a
href="http://www.subnettingmadeeasy.blogspot.com/2007/11/subnetting-made-easy-lesson.html">Subnetting
Made Easy</a> that gives an excellent and mercifully short explanation of how to subnet. 
The way he describes is exactly how I do it too.  This technique works well, but I've
always found it a little hard to explain to others, I'm glad someone else found a good way
to convey it.

Very good practice tool! I am suprised at how quick I am getting at solving

skip past the easier ones without feeling like a failure when you see the

Hey Steve, it's a nice gadget, however it seems it outputs incorrect
data.
<br />

<br />
IP address: 168.180.105.116
<br />
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.224
<br />
Network address is cool: 
<br />
10101000 10110100 01101001 01100000
<br />
168.180.105.96
<br />

<br />
But the broadcast address is incorrect:
<br />

<br />
IP address: 
<br />
10101000 10110100 01101001 01110100
<br />
invert subnet mask: 
<br />
00000000 00000000 00000000 00011111 
<br />

<br />
Your broadcast:
<br />
10101000 10110100 01101001 01111111
<br />
168.180.105.127
<br />

<br />
My broadcast:
<br />
10101000 10110100 01101001 01101011
<br />
168.180.105.107
<br />

<br />
Maybe there's still something with the spaces or the XOR doesn't work
correctly. Or I'm doing something wrong. :-)

Great site for REALLY learning subnetting as the questions really make one
think.  I have a question about this one:
<br />
121.126.143.200
<br />
240.0.0.0
<br />
The answer, which I got wrong, shows the broadcast as 127.255.255.255 My
understanding is that anything 127.n.n.n is loopback and I put the answer
as being the last usable address before the loopback: 126.255.255.255
<br
/>

<br />
Any comments appreciated.  Thanks for the site.  I did a Google search for
hard subnetting questions and found you (eventually--linked from another

Visitor, I'm glad you found the site helpful!  As you found my test doesn't
handle 127.x.x.x in any special way. An improvement would be to make it
skip that network range. I should probably review the rfcs and make sure no
bogus network ranges are ever issued. I'd love to get that fix in, and
there are a couple of other good suggestions in the comments here that
would be good to implement too. Maybe soon :-). <br />

Thanks for the coding to implement this useful test. I have a few
quesitons, as the classes that I have been included in all teach different
techniques for subnetting. In this class which is Network+ (Military side),
here is the way the teacher is conducting...
<br />

<br />
IP Address: 208.2.172.5
<br />
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
<br />

<br />
1) How many subnets do we need?
<br />
2) How many bits do you have?
<br />
3) What is your subnet mask?
<br />
4) What is your subnet (block) size?
<br />
5) What are you useable subnets?
<br />
6) What are the number of hosts/and IP range?
<br />

<br />
How can I implement the instructions on the guide that you've posted to
adapt to these questions?<br />
