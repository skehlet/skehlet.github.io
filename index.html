	<h2>Old Blog</h2> 

	<p>
		Some time ago, I maintained a blog. While much of it was photos of cats
		and other content I‘d consider now to be rather dated, I‘ve preserved a
		few articles that were well received, including 
		<a href="/articles/99.html">Tuning TCP for High Bandwidth-Delay
		Networks</a>
		and <a href="/subnetting-is-fun/index.html">an
		online IPv4 subnetting quiz</a> for those prepping for Cisco networking
		certification exams. More information is available on <a
		href="/articles/blog.html">My Blog Has Been
		Retired</a>.
